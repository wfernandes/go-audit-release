# go-audit-release
Bosh Release for slackhq/go-audit tool

###Purpose
Run the job space-audity on your bosh vms to capture relevant audit logs.

Use the [go-audit](https://github.com/slackhq/go-audit) tool to redirect the audit logs to a syslog server.

###Note
The job - space-audity; is an homage to David Bowie who left us earlier this year.
