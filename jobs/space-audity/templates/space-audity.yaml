# Please note that until this bug https://github.com/spf13/viper/pull/165 is fixed      #
# you _must_ specify all values despite the fact that they talk about having a default. #
# Hopefully this problem with viper goes away soon                                      #

# Configure socket buffers, leave unset to use the system defaults
# Values will be doubled by the kernel
# It is recommended you do not set any of these values unless you really need to
socket_buffer:
  # Default is net.core.rmem_default (/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default)
  # Maximum max is net.core.rmem_max (/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max)
  receive: 16384

# Configure message sequence tracking
message_tracking:
  # Track messages and identify if we missed any, default true
  enabled: true

  # Log out of orderness, these messages typically signify an overloading system, default false
  log_out_of_order: false

  # Maximum out of orderness before a missed sequence is presumed dropped, default 500
  max_out_of_order: 500

# Configure where to output audit events to
output:
  syslog:
    enabled: true

    # Total number of attempts to send a message before considering the syslog server gone
    # If a write fails go-audit will sleep for 1 second before retrying
    # default is 3
    attempts: 5

    # Configure the type of socket this should be, default is unixgram
    # This maps to `network` in golangs net.Dial: https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Dial
    network: unixgram

    # Sets the facility and severity for all events. See the table below for help
    # The default is 132 which maps to local0 | warn

    # Typically the name of the program generating the message. The PID is of the process is appended for you: [1233]
    # Default value is "go-audit"
    tag: "audit-thing"

# Configure logging, only stdout and stderr are used.

# If kaudit filtering isn't powerful enough you can use the following filter mechanism
filters:
  # Each filter consists of exactly 3 parts
  - syscall: 49 # The syscall id of the message group (a single log line from go-audit), to test against the regex
    message_type: 1306 # The message type identifier containing the data to test against the regex
    regex: saddr=(10..|0A..) # The regex to test against the message specific message types data
